# impress-outfit-logs

[Dress to Impress](https://github.com/openneo/impress) has a lot of outfit images stored on Amazon S3, and it costs quite a bit!! And people still use the S3-specific URLs on their sites for image embeds. We'd like to wind down the Amazon service in favor of our new stuff, while minimizing the disruption to sites that depend on it.

So, our plan is to _compress_ images that are still in use (they're not very optimized right now!), and _replace_ unused images with a small-filesize placeholder that links to further instructions!

So, this is a suite of tools to:
1. Download our Amazon S3 usage logs (generated by CloudTrail), and pull them into SQLite for analysis.
2. Backup images, and replace them with either a compressed version or a placeholder, depending on usage!
